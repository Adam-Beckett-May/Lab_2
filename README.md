#MyShell Commands
Welcome to MyShell, the one-stop source for all your file processing needs. It may look like an old-fashioned DOS and a place to get lost, but knowing which commands make it work will make navigating your content a cinch! Here's what you can do and how to do it (these commands are listed alphabetically; enter them exactly as we tell you and press enter to execute them):
## cd <directory>
Going from place to place in the shell to open files and do other tasks requires you to first set MyShell to point to the location where your file is or will be. To do this, type in "cd " (note the space) followed by the location where you want to set the directory to. If your location exists, you'll see it on the screen. If not, you'll get an error and will be able to enter another name.
## clr
Bothered by all that text on the screen? Type in "clr" and poof, a nice, clean, empty screen prepared just for you!
## dir <directory>
You might want to find out what files are in a certain place in your system. With MyShell, checking what's in any directory, including the one that MyShell is set to is as easy as keying in "dir " (note the space) and if needed, the directory you want to search. Then you'll know whether you've found the file you want.
## environ
For those technical geeks that want to see the environment strings in MyShell, "environ" should do the trick.
## echo <comment>
If you've ever want to print your own message on MyShell, this is your chance. Begin this command with "echo " (note the space) and then the comment you want MyShell to print to the screen. Be creative! That's what echoing is for!
## help
Need help using MyShell? You know what to do then: use your keyboard and call for "help".
## pause
When you feel like MyShell is doing too much or not working or just want to panic, entering "pause" will temporarily put MyShell to sleep. To wake it up, hit Enter.
## quit
Done with MyShell? You can always "quit" the program and once you do, boom, you're out of here.
